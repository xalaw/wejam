# WeJam

WeJam is a music collaboration app that allows you to make music with others online asynchronously. With some inspiration from Ben Pardo for suggesting african drumming as a model for asynchrounousity. This app was renamed from symphesis. The live version no longer runs on [Heroku](http://symphesis.herokuapp.com).

# Features

### Tech

Symphesis uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [React] - the streaming build system for frontend io.
* [Redux] - state management for React.
* [Socket IO] - for broadcasting events to an endpoint
* [Multer] -  for write data to server
* [Yarn] - for package management
* [Heroku] - for deployment / hosting our app
* [Mongo] - for storage of users
* [Passport] - for authentication
* [HTML5/CSS] - the language to make anything appear in the browser.

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub
